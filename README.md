## What is Nano-chat
Nano-chat is a GitHub project that aims to create a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) models on Jetson Nano. Jetson Nano is a small and powerful computer that can run deep learning applications at the edge. NLP models are trained to understand and generate natural language from text or speech. By combining Jetson Nano and NLP models, nano chat can provide a fast and interactive chatbot experience for various domains and purposes.

## Go ahead...
The project consists of three main components: the NLP model, the chat interface, and the deployment script. The NLP model is based on GPT-3, a large-scale language model that can generate coherent and diverse texts. The chat interface is a web-based application that allows users to interact with the chatbot through text or voice input. The deployment script is a set of instructions that help users to install and run nano chat on their own Jetson Nano device.
